## **üìã Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on both your home server and AWS EC2 instance.
- A **Cloudflare account** with a domain name configured.
- A **Tailscale account** for secure networking.
- Basic knowledge of **DNS management** and **Docker commands**.

---

## **üîß Key Components**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cloudflare (DNS & Security)**
- **Cloudflare is used for DNS management** and protecting your domain.
- An **A record** in Cloudflare points your **domain to your AWS EC2 instance**.
- **Proxied mode (orange cloud) is enabled** for added security.
- **Cloudflare handles SSL/TLS termination and firewall protection**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS EC2 (Cloud Server)**
- Runs **Caddy inside Docker** to **reverse proxy** traffic to your home server.
- **Tailscale is installed on the host machine** to securely tunnel traffic.
- **Cloudflare protects the EC2 instance from direct public access**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Home Server (Nextcloud AIO & Tailscale)**
- **[Nextcloud AIO](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one)** is used to provide a **self-hosted cloud storage solution**.
- **Tailscale runs inside Docker**, connecting securely to AWS EC2.
- No direct public exposure‚Äî**all traffic routes through Tailscale**.

## **üîÑ Workflow & Traffic Flow**

Below is a visual representation of the workflow:

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   User Browser    |       |    Cloudflare     |       |      AWS EC2      |
|  yourdomain.com   | ----> |   DNS & Security  | ----> |   Caddy Reverse   |
|                   |       |                   |       |      Proxy        |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
                                                             |
                                                             v
                                                   +-------------------+
                                                   |    Home Server    |
                                                   | Nextcloud AIO via |
                                                   |    Tailscale      |
                                                   +-------------------+
```

1. **User accesses `yourdomain.com` via Cloudflare**.
2. **Cloudflare forwards requests to AWS EC2 (Caddy running in Docker)**.
3. **Caddy proxies traffic to the Tailscale node running on the home server**.
4. **Tailscale securely forwards the request to Nextcloud AIO (port 11000)**.
5. **Nextcloud AIO serves the request and sends responses back via the same path**.

---

## **üí° Use Case: No Port Forwarding Required**
Many ISPs **do not allow port forwarding** or provide **dynamic IPs**, making self-hosting difficult.  
This architecture **eliminates the need for port forwarding** by using **Tailscale** as a secure private tunnel, allowing access to your **home server from anywhere** without exposing it to the internet.

---

## **üìÇ Uploading Large Files**
### **Cloudflare Proxy Mode Limitations**
- Even though **Nextcloud AIO uses 100MB chunking by default**, when using **Cloudflare's proxy mode**, uploads larger than **~3.5GB** often fail.
- **Upload speed is also significantly slower** due to Cloudflare‚Äôs processing overhead.

### **Workaround for Large Files**
To upload large files **without Cloudflare's limitations**, follow these steps:
1. **Temporarily disable Cloudflare proxy** (turn off the orange cloud in Cloudflare DNS settings).  
2. **Upload files to Nextcloud** using direct access through your domain.
3. **Re-enable Cloudflare proxy** after completing the upload.

### **Performance Improvement Observed**
- **By disabling Cloudflare proxy, uploads work reliably** even for very large files.
- **Observed upload speed is ~3MBps**, which is much faster than when using Cloudflare proxy.
- If anyone finds **further optimizations**, please **create a pull request**.
- If there are **security improvement suggestions**, feel free to **comment**.

---

## **üîí Security Enhancements**
- **Only ports 443 (HTTPS) & 22 (SSH for management) are open on EC2**.
- **Cloudflare protects against DDoS and malicious requests**.
- **Tailscale prevents direct exposure of the home server to the internet**.
- **Cloudflare SSL ensures encrypted connections**.
- **Regular updates for Docker containers and system packages are recommended**.

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Deployment & Configuration**
1. **Set up Cloudflare DNS**:
   - Create an **A record** pointing your domain to EC2.
   - Enable **proxied mode** for security.

2. **Deploy Nextcloud AIO & Tailscale on the Home Server**:
   - Use the `compose.yml` in the `HomeServer` directory to start **Nextcloud AIO** & **Tailscale**.

3. **Deploy Caddy on AWS EC2**:
   - Use the `compose.yml` in the `EC2` directory to start **Caddy** with the Cloudflare DNS plugin.

4. **Secure Everything**:
   - Use **Cloudflare firewall rules** to block unwanted traffic.
   - Configure **Cloudflare SSL/TLS settings**.
   - Regularly **update all containers and packages**.

---
